# Hackathon-Project
The goal of the implementation of Deadman Switch is to provide a secure, decentralized method for releasing secret assets or information to nominees after the owner's death or incapacitation. The real-life use case of this project is to prevent a digital asset from losing forever, when the button is no longer pressed by the owner, those valuable digital asset transfer to beneficiaries. The block diagram Figure 1 shown below illustrates our entire idea.  We define four major side of the project, the sender who owns the secret, the receiver who receives the secret if the sender dies, the service that keeps the secret with AES encryption method and smart contract on test ethernet. Our motto was to gain knowledge about complete fintech product development using wide tools and language.
